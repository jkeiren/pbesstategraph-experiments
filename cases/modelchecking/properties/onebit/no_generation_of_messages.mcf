% The protocol does not generate new messages
% Obtained from: "Tools for parameterized Boolean Equation Systems",
% S. Janssen, MSc. thesis
%
% Intuitively this expresses that, from the initial state of the protocol,
% any message d cannot be delivered until after a d has been read
% through ra.
forall d: D. nu X. (([!ra(d)]X && [sb(d)]false))
